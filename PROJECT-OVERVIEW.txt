1. Data Loading:
Load the Titanic dataset using a tool like pandas. This step involves reading the dataset into a DataFrame, a tabular data structure.
2. Data Inspection:
Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure and the type of information it contains.
Check for the presence of missing values in the dataset using methods like isnull() and sum().
3. Data Cleaning:
Address missing values by deciding whether to fill them or drop rows/columns with missing data.
For example, missing age values might be filled with the median age of passengers.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore relationships between variables using visualizations like bar plots and histograms.

Survival Rate by Class: Use a bar plot to show the survival rate for each passenger class.
Survival Rate by Gender: Explore how survival rates differ between genders.
Survival Rate by Age: Utilize a histogram to examine the distribution of ages among survivors and non-survivors.
Identify patterns and trends in the data:

Passenger Class Distribution: Visualize the distribution of passengers across different classes.
Age Distribution: Plot a histogram to show the age distribution of passengers.
Explore correlation between variables:

Create a correlation matrix and visualize it using a heatmap. This helps identify relationships between numerical variables.
5. Interpretation:
Based on the visualizations and analyses, draw insights and conclusions about the dataset.
For example, you might observe that passengers in higher classes had a higher survival rate or that age distribution was skewed toward younger passengers.
6. Further Analysis:
Depending on your goals, you can perform more in-depth analyses or statistical tests to validate your findings.
For instance, you might want to conduct a statistical test to confirm if there is a significant difference in survival rates between different passenger classes.
